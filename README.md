# The `crun-qemu` OCI runtime

This is an **experimental** [OCI Runtime] that enables [Podman] and [Docker] to
run VM images. The objective is to make running VMs (in simple configurations)
as easy as running containers, using standard container tooling and (mostly)
standard options and without the need to go in-depth into virtualization
technologies like libvirt.

## Installing

### Build and install from source (on Fedora)

1. Install `crun-qemu`'s runtime dependencies:

   ```console
   $ dnf install bash coreutils crun genisoimage libvirt-client libvirt-daemon-driver-qemu libvirt-daemon-log qemu-img qemu-system-x86-core shadow-utils util-linux virtiofsd
   ```

2. Install Rust and Cargo if you don't already have Rust tooling available:

   ```console
   $ dnf install cargo
   ```

3. Build `crun-qemu`:

   ```console
   $ cargo build
   ```

4. Copy the `target/debug/crun-qemu` executable to wherever you prefer, for
   instance `/usr/local/bin/`:

   ```console
   $ cp target/debug/crun-qemu /usr/local/bin/
   ```

5. If you're using Podman:

     - Merge the following configuration into the
       `/etc/containers/containers.conf` file, creating it if it doesn't exist
       (adjust the path below according to where you copied `crun-qemu` to):

       ```toml
       [engine.runtimes]
       crun-qemu = ["/usr/local/bin/crun-qemu"]
       ```

   If you're using Docker:

     - Merge the following configuration into the `/etc/docker/daemon.json`
       file, creating it if it doesn't exist (adjust the path below according to
       where you copied `crun-qemu` to):

       ```json
       {
         "runtimes": {
           "crun-qemu": {
             "path": "/usr/local/bin/crun-qemu"
           }
         }
       }
       ```

     - In file `/etc/sysconfig/docker`, replace the line:

       ```
       --default-ulimit nofile=1024:1024 \
       ```

       With:

       ```
       --default-ulimit nofile=262144:262144 \
       ```

     - Reload the `docker` service for the new configuration to take effect:

       ```console
       $ service docker reload
       ```

When using Podman, it is possible to run the examples below and elsewhere in
this repo without actually installing `crun-qemu`, *i.e.*, performing only steps
1â€“3. In this case, you must replace `--runtime crun-qemu` with `--runtime
"$PWD"/target/debug/crun-qemu` when running the examples.

## Overview

Here we overview some of the major features provided by `crun-qemu`.

The examples below use Podman, but unless otherwise stated you can use Docker
instead without any changes to the arguments.

### Booting VMs

#### From regular VM image files

First, obtain a QEMU-compatible VM image and place it in a directory by itself:

```console
$ mkdir my-vm-image
$ curl -LO --output-dir my-vm-image https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/39/Cloud/x86_64/images/Fedora-Cloud-Base-39-1.5.x86_64.qcow2
```

Then run:

> This example does not work with Docker, as docker-run does not support the
> `--rootfs` flag; see the next section for a Docker-compatible way of running
> VM images.

```console
$ podman run \
    --runtime crun-qemu \
    --security-opt label=disable \
    -it --rm \
    --rootfs my-vm-image \
    ""
```

The VM console should take over your terminal. To abort the VM, press `ctrl-]`.

You can also detach from the VM without terminating it by pressing `ctrl-p,
ctrl-q`. Afterwards, reattach by running:

> For this command to work with Docker, you must replace the `--latest` flag
> with the container's name or ID.

```console
$ podman attach --latest
```

This command also works when you start the VM in detached mode using
podman-run's `-d`/`--detach` flag.

It's also possible to omit flags `-i`/`--interactive` and `-t`/`--tty` to
podman-run, in which case you won't be able to interact with the VM but can
still observe its console. Note that pressing `ctrl-]` will have no effect, but
you can always use the following command to terminate the VM:

> For this command to work with Docker, you must omit the `--time=0` option and
> replace the `--latest` flag with the container's name or ID.

```container
$ podman container rm --force --time=0 --latest
```

#### From VM image files packaged into container images

`crun-qemu` also works with container images that contain a VM image file with
any name under `/` or under `/disk/`. No other files may exist in those
directories. Containers built for use as [KubeVirt `containerDisk`s] follow this
convention, so you can use those here:

```console
$ podman run \
    --runtime crun-qemu \
    --security-opt label=disable \
    -it --rm \
    quay.io/containerdisks/fedora:39 \
    ""
```

You can also use `util/package-vm-image.sh` to easily package a VM image into a
container image, and `util/extract-vm-image.sh` to extract a VM image contained
in a container image.

### First-boot customization

#### cloud-init

In the examples above, you were able to boot the VM but not to login. To fix
this and do other first-boot customization, you can provide a [cloud-init]
NoCloud configuration to the VM by passing in the non-standard option
`--cloud-init` *after* the image specification:

> For this command to work with Docker, you must provide an absolute path to
> `--cloud-init`.

```console
$ ls examples/cloud-init/config/
meta-data  user-data  vendor-data

$ podman run \
    --runtime crun-qemu \
    --security-opt label=disable \
    -it --rm \
    quay.io/containerdisks/fedora:39 \
    --cloud-init examples/cloud-init/config
```

You should now be able to login with the default `fedora` username and password
`pass`.

#### Ignition

Similarly, you can provide an [Ignition] configuration to the VM by passing in
the `--ignition` option:

> For this command to work with Docker, you must provide an absolute path to
> `--ignition`.

```console
$ podman run \
    --runtime crun-qemu \
    --security-opt label=disable \
    -it --rm \
    quay.io/crun-qemu/example-fedora-coreos:39 \
    --ignition examples/ignition/config.ign
```

You should now be able to login with the default `core` username and password
`pass`.

### SSH'ing into the VM

Assuming the VM supports cloud-init and exposes an SSH server on port 22, you
can `ssh` into it using podman-exec as whatever user cloud-init considers to be
the default for your VM image:

> For this command to work with Docker, you must replace the `--latest` flag
> with the container's name or ID.

```console
$ podman run \
    --runtime crun-qemu \
    --security-opt label=disable \
    --detach --rm \
    quay.io/containerdisks/fedora:39 \
    ""
47e7aab2b1a52054f5904ccb108854db23885258f1bd0d87241740212f4fc9af

$ podman exec --latest fedora whoami
fedora

$ podman exec -it --latest fedora
[fedora@ibm-p8-kvm-07-guest-07 ~]$
```

If the VM supports Ignition instead, you can use this method to `ssh` into it as
user `core`.

The `fedora` argument to podman-exec above, which would typically correspond to
the command to be executed, determines instead the name of the user to `ssh`
into the guest as. A command can optionally be specified with further arguments.
If no command is specified, a login shell is initiated. In this case, you
probably also want to pass flags `-it` to podman-exec.

If you actually just want to exec into the container in which the VM is running
(probably to debug some problem with `crun-qemu` itself), pass in `-` as the
username.

### Port forwarding

You can use podman-run's standard `-p`/`--publish` option to set up TCP and/or
UDP port forwarding:

```console
$ podman run \
    --runtime crun-qemu \
    --security-opt label=disable \
    --detach --rm \
    -p 8000:80 \
    quay.io/crun-qemu/example-http-server:latest \
    ""
36c8705482589cfc4336a03d3802e7699f5fb228123d18e693488ac7b80116d1

$ curl localhost:8000
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Directory listing for /</title>
</head>
<body>
[...]
```

### Passing things through to the VM

#### Directory bind mounts

Bind mounts are passed through to the VM as [virtiofs] file systems:

> For this command to work with Docker, you must provide an absolute path to
> `--cloud-init`.

```console
$ podman run \
    --runtime crun-qemu \
    --security-opt label=disable \
    -it --rm \
    -v ./util:/home/fedora/util \
    quay.io/containerdisks/fedora:39 \
    --cloud-init examples/cloud-init/config
```

If the VM image supports cloud-init or Ignition, the volume will automatically
be mounted inside the guest at the given destination path. Otherwise, you can
mount it manually by running the following command in the guest:

```console
$ mount -t virtiofs /home/fedora/util /home/fedora/util
```

#### Block devices

If cloud-init or Ignition are supported by the VM, it is possible to pass block
devices through to it at a specific path using podman-run's `--device` flag
(this example assumes `/dev/ram0` to exist and to be accessible by the current
user):

> For this command to work with Docker, you must provide an absolute path to
> `--cloud-init`.

```console
$ podman run \
    --runtime crun-qemu \
    --security-opt label=disable \
    -it --rm \
    --device /dev/ram0:/home/fedora/my-disk \
    quay.io/containerdisks/fedora:39 \
    --cloud-init examples/cloud-init/config
```

You can also pass them in as bind mounts using the `-v`/`--volume` or `--mount`
flags.

#### Mediated (mdev) vfio-pci devices

Mediated vfio-pci devices (such as vGPUs) can be passed through to the VM by
specifying the non-standard `--vfio-pci-mdev` option with a path to the mdev's
sysfs directory:

> For this command to work with Docker, you must provide an absolute path to
> `--vfio-pci-mdev`.

```console
$ podman run \
    --runtime crun-qemu \
    --security-opt label=disable \
    -it --rm \
    quay.io/containerdisks/fedora:39 \
    --vfio-pci-mdev /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:02.0/5fa530b9-9fdf-4cde-8eb7-af73fcdeeaae
```

## How it works

Internally, `crun-qemu` uses [crun] to run a different container that in turn
uses [libvirt] to run a [QEMU] guest using the user-specified VM image.
